PREDICT Behavioral Repository: Instructions

***Unless otherwise noted, you will need to follow these instructions (in sequential order) every time you want to 
create a new report

Step 1: Open user-inputs.R script from the predict-behav-report folder

Step 2: Load packages needed to run reports
    ## Highlight and run lines 3 through 6

OPTIONAL step for Mac users (Window users can ignore):
* This only needs to be done ONCE and is required in order to run the site-maps script
  1. Install brew:
      In the Terminal, copy and paste the following line of code and press 'enter': 
      /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  2. Install gdal:
      In the Terminal, copy and paste the following line of code and press 'enter': 
      brew install gdal

Step 3: Enter country, illness, and taxa contact variables of interest (must be in quotations)

    ## line 10: country: select ONE country
    
    ## line 12: illness_outcomes: select up to 4 illness outcomes (separated by commas; note spelling)
            ### "sari", "ili", "encephalitis", "hemorrhagic_fever"
            ### these outcomes will be included in the tabular report and lasso report
            ### there is also the option to not enter any illness
            
    ## line 15: heatmap_taxa_outcomes: select up to 14 taxa outcomes (separated by commas; note spelling)
            ### "rodents", "bats", "nhp", "birds", "poultry", "carnivores", "ungulates", "pangolins",
             "goats_sheep", "camels", "swine", "cattle", "dogs", "cats"
            ### these outcomes will be included in the heatmap report
            ### at least one taxa MUST be included
            ### heatmap_taxa_outcomes <- taxa_names command will include all taxa
          
    ## line 19: tabular_lasso_taxa_outcomes: select up to 14 taxa types (separated by commas; note spelling)
            ### these outcomes will be included in the tabular report and lasso report
            ### "rodents", "bats", "nhp", "birds", "poultry", "carnivores", "ungulates", "pangolins",
             "goats_sheep", "camels", "swine", "cattle", "dogs", "cats"
            ### these outcomes will be included in the tabular report and lasso report
            ### there is also the option to not enter any taxa
             
  After selecting all of the user-entered parameters, highlight and run lines 10-19
      
             
Step 4: Confirm that illness_outcomes, heatmap_taxa_outcomes, tabular_lasso_taxa_outcomes: 
    ## Highlight and run lines 25-27
    
Step 5: Create discrete categories for continuous variables to run in the lasso
    ## Highlight and run lines 31-34

Step 6: Download EIDITH command: (NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED): line 39

    ## if run TRUE, eidith data will download (this is not always required and only necessary if there have
    been recent updates made to eidith)
    
    ## if run FALSE, the most recently downloaded version eidith will be used (recommended)

Step 7: Run Lasso command: (NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED): line 45

    ## if run TRUE, the lasso will run for all selected illness_outcomes and tabular_lasso_taxa_outcomes 
    
            ### Note 1: The lasso takes a long time to run (up to several hours in some cases); time to run is
            increased  with more selected outcomes
            ### Note 2: Once the lasso has been run for a specific taxa or illness, it is saved in the outputs  
            folder and does not need to be run again
          
    ## if run FALSE, the lasso will not run (recommended)
    
            ### Note: You can still view the lasso report if you select FALSE - you just need to make sure that
            you have already run the lasso with your selected taxa and illness outcomes. This can be checked in
            the outputs/lasso-figs folder.
    
    
*** WARNING: If the outcomes of interest (taxa or illness) have low or no positive responses (low prevalence), then the lasso will ultimately fail (i.e. you will receive an error message when you try to create the lasso report). Prior to running the lasso, check that the prevalence of each outcome you selected is at least 10%. You can check prevalence for all of the taxa and illness outcomes by highlighting and running lines 49-60.

Step 8: Create csv files to be used in the reports
    ## Highlight and run line 49
   
        ## Note: if you selected download_fresh <- TRUE (line 39), a new version of eidith will download
   
            ### If this is your first time downloading EIDITH in R, you will be asked for your EIDITH_NAME
            and EIDTH_PASSWORD. These will only need to be entered once
        
            ### You will see the following message in the console:
        
                  Local EIDITH database is missing tables.
                  Would you like to download missing tables? 

                      1: Yes
                      2: No
                  
                    #### select: 2
                    #### this message will appear every time you select download_fresh <- TRUE
    
            ### csv files can be found in the data folder
    
Step 9: Select which reports you want to run
    ## Highlight and run line 66
    ## Options include: "summary-report", "tabular-report". "site-maps", "heatmaps", "lasso"
  
Step 10: Create selected reports: 
    ## Highlight and run line 71
    ## All reports can be found in the outputs/reports folder
    ## All figures can be found in their associated folder within the outputs folder
    
    ## Note: if you selected run_lasso <- TRUE (line 45), the lasso will run at this time (and may take a long time)
  
  
Additional Information  
  
*** Every time the illness_outcomes, heatmap_taxa_outcomes, and/or tabular_lasso_taxa_outcomes are changed in the user-inputs.R script, new Tabular reports, Heatmap reports, and Lasso reports are generated in the outputs/reports folder. Unless you change the country of analysis, the Summary report and Sitemaps report will remain the same.

II. Report Information and Interpretation

1. Summary Report

The summary report provides counts, frequency percentages (for categorical variables) and averages/means (for numerical variables) of multiple site and respondent characteristics. 

Note: any "missing" response (from a categorical variable) si included in the total and frequency %. Any NA (i.e. missing) numerical variable (age; number of people living in dwelling; number of rooms in dwelling; crowding index; number of children in dwelling; number of men in dwelling) is not included in average (mean).


2. Tabular Report:
The tabular report consists of 4 sections:
    a. Categorical Tables
    b. Confidence Interval Plots
    c. Numeric Tables
    d. Median Plots

*It should be noted that variables in the Numeric Tables and Median Plots remain the same, regardless of the outcome variable. However, depending on the type of outcome variable (whether illness or taxa contact), the variables in the Categorical Tables and Confidence Interval Plots do change slightly.

a. The Categorical Tables provide 3 figures, parsed out by site and aggregated: 
  - outcome variable count (x): "number of successes" (i.e. number of positive outcomes)
  - total site/aggregate count (n): "number of trials"
  - binomial probability with 95% confidence interval: 
          - binomial probability (p = x/n): the probability of successes (x) given (n) number of trials
          - 95% confidence interval: the range with which we expect 95% of the binomial probability outcomes (p) to
            occur given a set number of successes (x) and "trials" (n)

b. The Confidence Interval Plots provide a visual representation of the Categorical Tables. When comparing the confidence interval plots, bars that do NOT overlap generally indicate statistically significant differences between the levels of the predictor variable with regards to the outcome variable. Plots with overlapping bars do not necessarily imply that there is no statistically significant variation between the levels of the predictor variable (especially if the bars overlap just slightly), but will require additional analyses (for example: a chi-square test, fisher-exact test, or logistic regression). Bars with a very large range should be interpreted with caution (especially those where the binomial probability point is located at the very top or bottom of the range), as they generally refer to variables with very extreme (high or low) counts.

c. The Numeric Tables provide 2 figures, parsed out by site and aggregated:
    - count for each level of the outcome (yes/no)
          - within each site, the count of each outcome level will equal the total respondent count
    - median with 95% confidence interval
          - median: we used the median instead of the mean to account for outliers and non-normal distributions
          - 95% confidence interval: range with which we are 95% certain that the true population median occurs

d. The Median Plots are visual representations of the Numeric Tables. The interpretation of these plots is similar to the Confidence Interval Plots. 

Note 1: the specific livelihoods listed in the Categorical Tables and Confidence Interval Plots refers to ANY 
livelihood indicated within the previous year (see: Q24 in the human behavior questionnaire and/or 'Livelihood Activities (past year) All' in the Summary Report).

Note 2: any categorical variables with "missing" responses are excluded, as are any numerical variables with NA (i.e. NULL) responses. 


Sample tabular report interpretations:
outcome variable: bat contact
categorical predictor: gender (male/female)
numerical predictor: age

Sample 1: categorical

            bat contact     total count     Binomial Probability (95% CI)  
      
Gender
  male          20              50                0.40 (0.28 - 0.54)
  female        10              100               0.10 (0.03 - 0.20)

Within the sample, males have between a 40% probability of having had contact with bats (95% CI, 0.28 - 0.54), compared to a 10% probability of bat contact among women (95% CI, 0.03 - 0.20). The probability of bat contact is significantly higher among men, since the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap.

Note: the Confidence Interval Plots would show two bars that do not overlap.

Sample 2: numerical

                      count       Median (95% CI)  
      
Age
  bat contact           30          40 (36 - 44)
  no bat contact        120         45 (40 - 51)

Within the sample, individuals with bat contact have a median age of 40 (95% CI, 36 - 44), compared to those without bat contact who have a median age of 45 (95% CI, 40 - 51). Given that the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, there is no statistically significant difference in age among those with and without bat contact.

Note: the Median Plots would also show two bars that do overlap.


2. Lasso Report:
The lasso report shows which variables are positively (indicated by an orange dot; odds ratio greater than 1) and inversely (indicated by a purple dot; odds ratio less than 1) associated with the outcome variable of interest. The lasso itself removes predictor variables that are highly correlated and ranks variables based on the coefficients.

There are 2 coefficients presented in the lasso:
    - s: shrinkage term
          - ranks the "importance" of each predictor on the outcome variable
          - s = 0 indicates that within the entire model (that includes all the predictor variables), that particular             variable is not a useful predictor
          - s = 1 and s = -1 indicate a predictor variable that has a high amount of influence within the model;
            1 indicates a positive association and -1 indicates a negative/inverse association
    - n: count
          - total count where both the predictor variable and outcome variable are positive (i.e. are both "yes")

The lasso is useful in identifying certain predictor variables that are strongly associated with the outcome variable of interest. Additional analyses with these predictor variables are recommended.
